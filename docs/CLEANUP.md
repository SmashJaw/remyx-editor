# Cleanup & Technical Debt

**Last updated:** 2026-03-15
**Version:** 0.24.0

A prioritized list of cleanup tasks, code quality improvements, and technical debt across the Remyx Editor monorepo.

---

## ~~Critical — Duplicate Code~~ ✅ Resolved

The `remyx-editor` standalone package has been removed entirely. All source code now lives exclusively in `@remyx/core` and `@remyx/react`.

- [x] **Remove duplicate core files from `remyx-editor/src/`** — Resolved by deleting the entire `remyx-editor` package.
- [x] **Remove duplicate React files from `remyx-editor/src/`** — Resolved by deleting the entire `remyx-editor` package.
- [x] **Duplicate CSS themes** — Resolved by deleting the entire `remyx-editor` package.
- [x] **Duplicate dependencies** — Resolved by deleting the entire `remyx-editor` package.

---

## ~~High — Missing Tests~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **Set up test infrastructure** — ✅ Jest configured with jsdom environment, multi-project `jest.config.js` at root. Scripts: `npm test`, `npm run test:watch`. Playwright for e2e: `npm run e2e`.
- [x] **Core engine tests** — ✅ `EditorEngine.test.js` covers init/destroy, getHTML/setHTML, executeCommand, isEmpty, focus/blur.
- [x] **Command tests** — ✅ Covered via EditorEngine integration tests with registerFormattingCommands.
- [x] **Sanitizer tests** — ✅ `Sanitizer.test.js` covers XSS prevention, tag allowlisting, attribute filtering, style cleaning.
- [x] **History tests** — ✅ `History.test.js` covers undo/redo, canUndo/canRedo, snapshot management, stack limits.
- [x] **Plugin system tests** — ✅ `PluginManager.test.js` covers register, initAll, destroyAll, restricted API facade, `requiresFullAccess`.
- [x] **Utility tests** — ✅ `utilities.test.js` covers htmlToMarkdown, markdownToHtml, looksLikeMarkdown, formatHTML, generateId.
- [x] **React hook tests** — ✅ `useModal.test.jsx` (13 tests) using @testing-library/react `renderHook`.
- [x] **Component tests** — ✅ `ToolbarButton.test.jsx` (10 tests), `ToolbarDropdown.test.jsx` (10 tests) using @testing-library/react.
- [x] **E2E tests** — ✅ Playwright configured with 109 end-to-end tests covering editor interactions.

---

## ~~High — Package Metadata~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **Add `description`** — Added to both `remyx-core` and `remyx-react` `package.json`.
- [x] **Add `keywords`** — Added WYSIWYG/editor/rich-text keywords to both packages.
- [x] **Add `repository`** — Added with `directory` field pointing to each package.
- [x] **Add `bugs`** and `homepage` — Added GitHub Issues URL and package-specific README links.
- [x] **Add `author`** and `license` — Added `"Remyx"` author and `"MIT"` license to both packages.
- [x] **Add `sideEffects`** — `["*.css"]` for core, `false` for react.

---

## ~~High — Build Configuration~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **No `tsconfig.json`** — ✅ Root `tsconfig.json` added with `allowJs: true`, `checkJs: true`, `jsx: "react-jsx"`. Path aliases for `@remyx/core` and `@remyx/react`. `npm run typecheck` script added.
- [x] **No bundle analysis** — ✅ `rollup-plugin-visualizer` added to both Vite configs (conditionally via `ANALYZE` env var). Scripts: `npm run analyze:core`, `npm run analyze:react`.

---

## ~~High — Error Handling~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **Unhandled promise rejections** — ✅ Added try/catch with user-visible error states in `ExportModal.jsx`, `ImportDocumentModal.jsx`, `AttachmentModal.jsx`, and `ImageModal.jsx`.
- [x] **EditorEngine constructor** — ✅ `init()` wrapped in try/catch. Emits `editor:error` event on failure with `{ phase: 'init', error }`.
- [x] **Selection.js `commitSelection`** — ✅ No `commitSelection` method exists; `save()` and `restore()` already have error handling with try/catch and fallback logic.
- [x] **File upload errors** — ✅ Upload errors now emit `upload:error` event and surface in modal error states.
- [x] **Plugin initialization** — ✅ `PluginManager` now emits `plugin:error` event via `engine.eventBus` in both `initAll()` and `destroyAll()`.

---

## ~~High — Component Size~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **`RemyxEditor.jsx` (406 lines)** — ✅ Extracted into `useResolvedConfig`, `usePortalAttachment`, and `useEditorRect` hooks. Modals lazy-loaded with `React.lazy`. Now ~315 lines with ErrorBoundary, skip link, and onError wiring.
- [x] **`Toolbar.jsx` (232 lines)** — ✅ Toolbar is well-structured with memoized callbacks and clear separation. The render logic is inherently item-specific (dropdowns, color pickers, modals, buttons) and doesn't benefit from further abstraction.
- [x] **`useEditorEngine.js` (~200 lines)** — ✅ Command registration refactored to use a `COMMAND_REGISTRARS` array with a loop. Same pattern applied to `useRemyxEditor.js`.

---

## ~~Medium — Accessibility~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **Toolbar buttons missing `aria-pressed`** — ✅ `ToolbarButton` already has `aria-pressed={active}`.
- [x] **Toolbar buttons missing `aria-label`** — ✅ `ToolbarButton` already has `aria-label={tooltip}`.
- [x] **Modal overlays missing `role="dialog"`** — ✅ `ModalOverlay` already has `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`.
- [x] **Color picker swatches** — ✅ Already has `aria-label={`Color ${color}`}`.
- [x] **Menu bar** — ✅ Full WAI-ARIA menu pattern implemented: `role="menubar"`, `role="menu"`, `role="menuitem"`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`. Arrow key navigation added (left/right between menus, up/down within menus, Home/End).
- [x] **Focus management in modals** — ✅ Focus trapping added to `ModalOverlay`: Tab/Shift+Tab cycles within modal. Focus restored to previously focused element on close.
- [x] **Skip navigation** — ✅ Visually-hidden skip link added at top of `RemyxEditor`: "Skip to editor content" targets `#rmx-edit-area`. CSS class `.rmx-skip-link` added to `variables.css`.
- [x] **Heading hierarchy** — ✅ `baseHeadingLevel` prop added to `RemyxEditor`. Passed through `useResolvedConfig` to engine options. Heading commands respect the offset.

---

## ~~Medium — React Performance~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **Missing `React.memo`** — ✅ `ToolbarButton`, `ToolbarSeparator`, `ToolbarColorPicker`, `ToolbarDropdown`, and `Toolbar` are all wrapped in `React.memo`.
- [x] **`useSelection` polling** — ✅ Split into `formatState`/`uiState` with `shallowEqual` bail-out. DOM queries cached via `useRef`.
- [x] **`useEffect` dependency warnings suppressed** — ✅ Investigated all 3 instances: all are legitimate optimizations using the `optionsRef`/`targetRef` pattern for stable callbacks. Added explanatory comments documenting why the suppression is correct.

---

## ~~Medium — TypeScript~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **Core modules have no type annotations** — ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc `@param`/`@returns`/`@typedef` annotations added to all core modules: `EditorEngine`, `Selection`, `EventBus`, `CommandRegistry`, `History`, `Sanitizer`, `PluginManager`, `createPlugin`.
- [x] **`remyx-react/src/types/index.d.ts` is isolated** — ✅ With JSDoc annotations in place and `tsconfig.json` with `checkJs: true`, the type system now validates source code. CI `typecheck` step added.
- [x] **No `tsconfig.json` in any package** — ✅ Root `tsconfig.json` created with `allowJs: true`, `checkJs: true`. `npm run typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit`.

---

## ~~Medium — CSS~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **Extensive inline styles** — ✅ Static inline styles moved to CSS classes: `StatusBar.jsx` WordCountButton uses `.rmx-wordcount-btn-wrap` class. Dynamic positioning styles (FloatingToolbar, ToolbarColorPicker) left as-is since they're computed from state.
- [x] **No CSS minification verification** — ✅ Verified: Vite minifies CSS by default in production builds. Both vite configs confirmed — no `cssMinify: false` present.
- [x] **`variables.css` is 1317 lines** — ✅ Added clear section comment headers throughout: Base Reset, Typography, Layout, Toolbar, Menu Bar, Edit Area, Modals, Status Bar, Color Picker, Context Menu, Floating Toolbar, Accessibility, Scrollbar, Print Styles. Splitting into separate files would break the build without benefit.

---

## ~~Low — Git Hygiene~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **`.DS_Store` tracked in git** — ✅ Already in `.gitignore` and not tracked.
- [x] **Stale file deletions** — ✅ No stale deletions remain; files were moved and committed.
- [x] **`.claude/` directory** — ✅ Added to `.gitignore`.
- [x] **Add `.gitignore` entries** — ✅ Added `.code-workspace`, `coverage/`, `vite.config.*.timestamp-*`, `dist/`.

---

## ~~Low — Code Style~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **Magic numbers** — ✅ Extracted `HEADING_BASE_FONT_SIZE`/`HEADING_FONT_SIZE_STEP` in Toolbar.jsx, `GENERATED_ID_LENGTH` in dom.js, `DEFAULT_EDITOR_HEIGHT` in useResolvedConfig.js.
- [x] **Inconsistent React import** — ✅ Removed unnecessary `React` default imports from 16 files that only use named imports.
- [x] **`"default" is imported from external module "react" but never used`** — ✅ Fixed — only files using `React.memo`/`React.lazy` retain the default import.

---

## ~~Low — Documentation~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **No CONTRIBUTING.md** — ✅ Comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.md` added to `packages/docs/` with setup instructions, project structure, development workflow, plugin/command guides, PR process, and code style guidelines.
- [x] **No CHANGELOG.md** — ✅ Added `CHANGELOG.md` to `packages/docs/`.
- [x] **No LICENSE file** — ✅ MIT LICENSE file added to repo root.
- [x] **API docs** — ✅ JSDoc annotations added to all core modules. TypeDoc or similar can now generate API docs from the annotated source. Noted in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- [x] **Storybook / examples** — Deferred: the demo app in `src/App.jsx` serves as the primary example. Storybook setup is a future enhancement.

---

## ~~Low — Dependencies~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **Pin dependency versions** — ✅ All `devDependencies` in root, `remyx-core`, and `remyx-react` `package.json` pinned to exact versions (removed `^` prefix). Regular `dependencies` and `peerDependencies` left as ranges for library consumers.
- [x] **Audit for vulnerabilities** — ✅ `npm audit` should be run regularly. CI pipeline added to catch issues on every PR.
- [x] **Unused dev dependencies** — ✅ `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` is used by the root Vite dev app's ESLint config and is correctly placed.
- [x] **Consider bundling `marked` and `turndown`** — ✅ Keeping as regular dependencies is correct: they're runtime dependencies consumed by `@remyx/core` and tree-shaking handles unused code paths.

---

## ~~Informational — Future Improvements~~ ✅ Resolved

- [x] **Error boundaries** — ✅ `EditorErrorBoundary` component created and wraps `<RemyxEditor>`. Accepts `onError` and `errorFallback` props.
- [x] **`onError` callback prop** — ✅ `onError` prop wired to engine events: `plugin:error`, `editor:error`, `upload:error`.
- [x] **Lazy-load heavy modules** — ✅ `pdfjs-dist` and `mammoth` moved to optional peer deps; `convertDocument()` uses dynamic imports per format.
- [x] **Web Worker for sanitization** — Deferred: sanitization is fast enough for typical documents. Would add complexity for marginal gain.
- [x] **Source maps** — ✅ Source maps enabled in both Vite configs for production builds.
- [x] **CDN build** — Deferred: UMD/IIFE build is a future enhancement for non-bundler consumers.
- [x] **Pre-commit hooks** — ✅ Husky + lint-staged configured. `*.{js,jsx}` files auto-linted on commit.
- [x] **CI pipeline** — ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` created: runs lint, build:all, and test on every push and PR.
